GreenBeanCasserole is Robot Casserole's web based match scouting system
We run this on tablets and get the data from scanning generated QR codes.

## MATCH INFO:
The match info section of this app has the things we need to know before a match.

First, type in who you are in the scout name bar. Then, choose what type of match they are playing in (qualification, practice, elimination). The settings you choose for this will stay until you change them again.

## AUTO:
This section of the app tells us what this team did in autonomous.

    Power Cells:

        The first section is to keep track of how much cargo they scored in the upper goal.
        
        The second section is to keep track of the amount of cargo they scored in the low goal.

        There is also an "Undo Score" button for any mistakes you make in either of the cargo categories.
    
Also, click on the checkbox if they left the tarmac in auto.

## TELEOP:
This section records what the team did in teleop.

Cargo tracking works the same as in auto.

However, in addition to the cargo tracking, there is also a climbing section.

    Climbing:

        There is a drop-down list of the possible climbing combinations.

            All that is needed is to click on the box and select the one that is appropiate. 
            ie. click on the bubble for "None" if they did not climb, the "Mid" button 
            if they climbed on the second lowest rung, etc.

## POST MATCH:
Post match section is all about how they did overall and also where the team shot from.

    Driver Rating:

        Click on the box and select the most appropiate option related to their driving skill.

    Defense Rating:

        Click on the box and select the most appropriate option related to their skill in defending.

    Intake Abilities:

        Click on the checkboxes if they are applicable to the robot. 
        As in, click on the checkbox for "Can Intake from ground" 
        if they can, indeed, intake from the ground.

Are they prone to getting penalties? If so, click on the penalty prone checkbox.

    Shooting Positions:

        If they shot from up close, then click "Close Shooting." If they shot from somewhere that isn't up close, click "Far Shooting." If they shot from a combination of these places, click both checkboxes.

        Be sure to use the map as a reference for what is close and what is far.

The comment section is for when you notice something that there is not an option for it in the app.

Once you've done all of this you must submit your report.

## MATCH HISTORY:
Match history is a backup to the data you've entered in the app and is also what the QR code is generated from.

To clear your match history you must have a password. It's meant to prevent accidental clearing of data, which is stored in browser local storage.
